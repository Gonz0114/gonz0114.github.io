       <h2>About Me </h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario July 1<sup>st</sup> 1998. I now attend my educational endeavors a 2nd time after previously having graduated the 3 year business administration and marketing program. I now aim to improve on my marketing skills by attending the interactive media and design course to further help round out my skill set.</p>
    
    
    <p> Outside of school, I have been known to pursue a variety of interest from rock climbing, gaming and photography, my most recent and exotic interest being that of the japanese martial art of <em> Kendo</em>, the way of the sword. this martial art is tied in both combative sport, as well as cerimonial tradition. I would love to continue competition for this sport and commit to it full-time however, given the niche nature of the martial art, that may prove difficult. </p>

    <p>During the Covid era, I picked up photography as a hobby to pursue. with a combination of portrait, and street photography, I ended up attracting multiple clients ranging from individuals to businesses. When it comes to photography I had to quickly study the multiple tools now at my disposal such as shutter speed, <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>, and <abbr title="Focal Length">F-stop</abbr>. Photography has become more than just a hobby but a way of life, doing whatever you can to capture the image and moment that you have in your head.
